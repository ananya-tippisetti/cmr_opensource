Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project leverages machine learning to provide a tool for early detection and prevention. The application allows users to input their health metrics and receive an immediate prediction regarding their heart disease risk.The dataset used for training the model is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more.The model is built using a combination of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and other metrics.The application provides a prediction of heart disease risk, along with the probability of the prediction. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall.

The feautures of this model include: User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, Predictive model trained on a well-known heart disease dataset, Real-time prediction of heart disease risk based on user inputs.

Prerequisites: Python newest version, Virtual environment (recommended).

The setup includes: Clone the repository, Create and activate a virtual environment, Install the required packages listed in the requirements text.

The output will be as follows:
